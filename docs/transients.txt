============
Transients
============

A transient photometry in :code:`redback` is implemented as a :code:`redback.transient` object. This class implements the required functionality for fitting and all other analysis.
It also provides a homogenous way to plot the data, or do any processing such as converting integrated flux to luminosity, fit a GP to the lightcurve, build a bolometric luminosity from photometry, etc

General transient object
-------------------------

There are two parent classes

- Transient: For any type of generic transient
- OpticalTransient: For any type of generic optical transient

Specific transient object
-------------------------

These parent classes are inherited by some transient specific classes, which provide additional functionality.

- Afterglow: afterglow of a gamma-ray burst

    - SGRB/LGRB:  short and long gamma-ray bursts
- Kilonova: For kilonovae
- Prompt: For prompt gamma-ray bursts
- Supernova: For supernovae of different varieties
- TDE: For tidal disruption events

These classes come with additional functionality and lookup tables which provide metadata useful for further analysis, such as redshift, T90, start time, etc.
They also allow other processing such as converting flux to luminosity.

We provide two methods for converting integrated flux to luminosity for GRB afterglow data, a simple analytical method, and a more involved method using `sherpa <https://sherpa.readthedocs.io/en/4.14.0/>`_.

For each of the transients we have different :code:`data_modes` which determines what data to fit, plot labels, type of likelihood to use etc.
We note that the latter two can be changed by users if desired.

Data modes
-------------------------

The data modes available for each transient are

- Afterglow: luminosity, flux, flux_density, magnitude
- Kilonova: flux_density, magnitude, flux
- Prompt: counts, time tagged events
- Supernova: flux_density, magnitude, luminosity, flux
- TDE: flux_density, magnitude, luminosity, flux

Loading catalog data
-------------------------

In :code:`redback`, we provide several class methods for loading data and creating a transient object.
For example loading and creating a transient object for data from the open access catalog is as simple as,

.. code:: python

    kne = 'at2017gfo'
    kilonova = redback.Kilonova.from_open_access_catalogue(name=kne,
                data_mode="flux_density", active_bands=np.array(["g", "i"]))

This loads the data from at2017gfo that was previously downloaded and creates a kilonova object, with the flux_density data mode. 
Here we have also specified :code:`active_bands=np.array(['g', 'i')`. This sets the rest of the data to be inactive, i.e., not used in the fitting.
All bands/frequencies are active by default.

We can use this transient object to create plots of the data.

.. code:: python

    kwargs = {}
    kilonova.plot_data()
    fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(12, 8))
    kilonova.plot_multiband(figure=fig, axes=axes,
                            filters=["g", "r", "i", "z", "y", "J"], **kwargs)

Here the first `plot_data` will plot the data with all bands on one plot. While the second will plot all filters in the list in separate panels.
We have also passed kwargs here (in this case empty) but can be populated with other keyword arguments to pass to matplotlib.
We have also passed in a `fig` and `axes` to set up the plot in the specific way we wanted.
We note that if no figure/axes/filters are passed then redback will use the defaults. More plotting documentation is available `here <https://redback.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting.html>`_.


Other transient objects can be constructed in a similar manner to the kilonova object.

.. code:: python

    prompt = '910505'
    GRB = '070809'
    sne = "SN2011kl"
    tde = "PS18kh"

    afterglow = redback.SGRB.from_swift_grb(name=GRB, data_mode='flux')
    tidal_disruption_event = redback.TDE.from_open_access_catalogue(tde, data_mode='magnitude')
    prompt = redback.PromptTimeSeries.from_batse_grb_name(name=name)
    supernova = redback.supernova.Supernova.from_open_access_catalogue(name=sne,
                                data_mode='flux_density', use_phase_model=True)

Which loads the SGRB, TDE, prompt, and Supernova transient objects with the data for the specific transient respectively.
Note that in the supernova object, we set :code:`phase_model=True`.
This sets the time attribute of the class to the modified julian date time of the observations.
This is specifically for situations when users want to also sample the start time of the transient.

Loading private/simulated data
-------------------------

The above showed the scenario where a user has used :code:`redback` to download the data.
In many cases, this is not possible as either a catalog is not implemented in :code:`redback`, or the data is simulated, or the data is private.

In this scenario, a user can still create the :code:`redback.transient` object and use it as they would otherwise.

We demonstrate this with data loaded from a pandas dataframe in the example
`here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/broadband_afterglow_private_data_example.py>`_.
An example to load the simulated data from :code:`redback` simulation module is shown `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/simulate_kilonova.py>`_.

In general, you can ignore the class methods and to create your own transient object by passing in the different attributes (time/flux/frequencies/bands) to the transient object of relevance.

For example,

.. code:: python

    import pandas as pd
    import redback

    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    time_days = data['time'].values
    flux_density = data['flux_density'].values
    frequency = data['frequency'].values
    flux_density_err = data['flux_density_err'].values

    name = '220501'
    afterglow = redback.afterglow(name=name, time=time_days, flux=flux_density,
                                    flux_density_err=flux_density_err, frequency=frequency)

We can again plot the data and multiband data

.. code:: python

    afterglow.plot_data()
    afterglow.plot_multiband()


These transient objects provide the interface to fit and interpret many types of electromagnetic transients.
In particular, broadband afterglows, kilonovae, prompt gamma-ray burst, supernovae, tidal disruption events,
magnetar powered transients, millisecond magnetars or any other generic electromagnetic transient. A more general example which shows the different ways to create transient objects in :code:`redback` is available
`here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/examples/creating_transient_objects.py>`_.

Working with transient data in MJD
-------------------------

Quite often the only time values we have are in MJD. In this case, we can set the time attribute of the transient object to be in MJD.
As an example,

.. code:: python

    import redback
    import pandas as pd

    # load your data
    data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    time_mjd = data['time'].values
    magnitude = data['mag'].values
    bands = data['frequency'].values
    mag_err = data['mag_err'].values

    name = 'my_transient'
    # note that we set the time_mjd instead of a time attribute
    # note that we set use_phase_model=True
    sn = redback.transient.Supernova(name=name, time_mjd=time_mjd, magnitude=flux_density,
                                    magnitude_err=mag_err, bands=bands, use_phase_model=True)

Now when we call the plot_data method, we will see the time in MJD. And the time attribute of the transient object will be in MJD.
To fit this we will need to use a phase model or a model that works with time data.
Please look at the rest of the documentation and examples for more details.

GP interpolation
-------------------------
:code:`redback` provides a simple interface for doing GP interpolation directly from the transient object.
This can be done to simply interpolate the data, and generate new data, or to do a GP fit with some mean model.

For example, we can do a GP interpolation of the data in the supernova object as follows,

.. code:: python

    # Use any transient object previously made.
    from george import kernels

    k1 = kernels.ConstantKernel(np.std(transient.y/transient.y.max()), ndim=2)
    k2 = kernels.Matern32Kernel([np.var(np.diff(transient.unique_frequencies)), 100], ndim=2)
    kernel = k1 * k2

    output = transient.fit_gp(mean_model="None", kernel=kernel, use_frequency=True)

Here we set :code:`mean_model="None"` to not use any mean model.
The :code:`kernel` is a product of two kernels, a constant kernel and a Matern32 kernel.
And :code:`use_frequency=True` to use the frequency data so that we can use a 2D kernel with time and the effective frequency of the different bands.
We could also pass in a mean model to use, such as a power law or a polynomial, or things like a Bazin or Gaussian model.
We could also just use a 1D kernel.

Note that this method only optimizes the GP hyperparameters and does not sample a posterior.
In the examples, we show how you can use a GP + a mean model and get a full posterior of the GP hyperparameters and the model.

The output here contains the GP object alongside a bunch of useful attributes. The GP fit can be plotted alongside the data using

.. code:: python
    band_colours = {"g": "green", "r": "red"}
    ax = sn.plot_data(show=False, band_colors=band_colors)
    ax.set_xscale("linear")
    ax.set_xlim(1, 200)
    ax = redback.analysis.plot_gp_lightcurves(sn, gp_output=output, axes=ax,
                                              band_colors=band_colors)

Where we can pass in additional keyword arguments to the plotting functions. Please look at the API and plotting documentation for more details.

This GP result can be used to generate a new set of data points via,

.. code:: python

    t_new = np.linspace(10, 150, 100)
    new_sn = redback.analysis.generate_new_transient_data_from_gp(output, t_new=t_new,
                                                                 transient=transient)

Where we are returned a new transient object with the new data points. Which works exactly like all other transient objects within :code:`redback`.

Again, we provide a notebook example `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/GP_tutorial_with_redback.ipynb>`_
and some other examples in the `examples <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/>`_ folder.

Blackbody temperature and radius estimation.
-------------------------
:code:`redback` provides a simple interface for estimating the blackbody temperature and radius of the transient object.
This is done by fitting a blackbody model to the data and estimating the temperature and radius from the best fit parameters.

For example, we can do this for the kilonova object as follows,

.. code:: python

    # Use any optical transient object previously made.
    # these can be passed to the method,
    # here we use the default values which are used if nothing is passed.
    bin_width = 1 # width with which to bin the data in days,
    min_filters = 3 # minimum number of filters/frequencies the epoch must have to be fit.

    # Some other things can also be passed to this function, look at the API.
    df_bb = kilonova.estimate_bb_params(distance=distance, bin_width=bin_width,
                                        min_filters=min_filters)

Here we are returned a pandas dataframe with the best fit temperature and radius and
their errors at times dictated by the bin widths where the transient also has a mininum number of filters.

We provide a detailed notebook example `here <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/estimating_blackbody_properties_with_redback.ipynb>`_.

Bolometric luminosity estimation.
-------------------------
:code:`redback` provides a simple interface for estimating the bolometric luminosity of the transient object.
This can be done either using a blackbody SED, or any other :code:`redback` SED or with some bolometric corrections.

For example, we can do this for the kilonova object as follows,

.. code:: python

    # Some other things can also be passed to this function, look at the API.
    df_lbol = kilonova.estimate_bolometric_luminosity(distance=distance, bin_width=bin_width,
                                                        min_filters=min_filters)

Here we are returned a pandas dataframe with the bolometric luminosity and its errors at times
dictated by the bin widths where the transient also has a minimum number of filters.
Note this method by default works assuming a blackbody SED, but we provide a simple option to include the effects of line blanketing as well as host/MW extinction.

This data can be easily used to create another transient object with the bolometric luminosity data and then fit.
Please look at the API for more details and the `examples <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/master/examples/estimating_lbols.ipynb>`_

Spectrum object
-------------------------

:code:`redback` also provides a :code:`spectrum` object which can be used to load, plot, and fit spectral energy distributions.
These are treated the same for all transients and are generic enough to describe any wavelength spectrum.
The spectrums can be fit with any :code:`redback` model or any user defined model. And some examples are provided in the
`examples <https://github.com/nikhil-sarin/redback/blob/examples/>`_ folder on the github repository.
